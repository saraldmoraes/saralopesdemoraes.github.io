I am a PhD candidate at the University of São Paulo (USP), Brazil. During my PhD, I was a visiting researcher at University College London (UCL), UK and the University of Coimbra (UC), Portugal. I am a member of the [HEROIC project: Health and Economic Impacts of Reducing Overheating in Cities](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/environmental-design/research-projects/2023/jul/heroic-health-and-economic-impacts-reducing-overheating-cities) and the [Urban Space and Health Research Group](https://espacourbanoesaude.iea.usp.br/).

I was trained in Geography and hold a Master's in Physical Geography from USP. 

My PhD aims to estimate the impacts of heatwaves, cold spells and mortality in São Paulo through an interdisciplinary lens. Within this framework, I focus on understanding the temporal and spatiotemporal distribution of the extreme heat and cold mortality risk related to social inequalities and the Urban Heat Island effect.
