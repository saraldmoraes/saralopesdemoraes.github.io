I am a PhD candidate at the University of São Paulo (USP), Brazil. During my PhD, I was a visiting researcher at University College London (UCL), UK and the University of Coimbra (UC), Portugal. I am a member of the HEROIC project: Health and Economic Impacts of Reducing Overheating in Cities and the Urban Space and Health Research Group.

I was trained in Geography and hold a Master's in Physical Geography from USP. 

My PhD aims to estimate the impacts of heatwaves, cold spells and mortality in São Paulo through an interdisciplinary lens. Within this framework, I focus on understanding the temporal and spatiotemporal distribution of the extreme heat and cold mortality risk related to social inequalities and the Urban Heat Island effect.
